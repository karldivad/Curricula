abstract = {In its second edition, Inline/Online: Fundamentals of the Internet and the World Wide Web continues to offer students an entertaining and pedagogically superior introduction to the Internet, Web Design, and HTML coding in textbook format. This new edition features enhanced coverage of FTP, discussion of a wider array of search engines, new material on cascading style sheets, and an expanded and up-to-the-minute presentation of the current state of e-commerce. Outside of the classroom, this book remains an excellent resource for anyone who is interested in recent computing developments, online information, and the Internet as the new social and economic frontier. Inline/Online distinguishes itself as a text by offering an in-depth treatment of the Internet for non-computer specialists, thus making it accessible to students from all majors. E-mail, Newsgroups/Mailing Lists, web programming, electronic publishing, and search engines are among the topics authors Ray Greenlaw and Ellen Hepp cover with flair and a sense of their relationship to real-world applications. Students begin by learning the basics of e-mail and by the end of the course have the skills to publish their own well-designed web pages. In addition, the book contains over 500 exercises, many of them new to the second edition, which allow the reader test and refine their new skills online. An Online Learning Center accompanies the book and offers an array of supplementary materials such as HTML examples, useful links, and rendered code from the book. McGraw-Hill's Page Out allows professors to customize the site by including their own course syllabus, a list of students, grading information, assignments, projects, and more}
