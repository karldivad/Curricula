"\KADescription{AL}{<<Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software engineering. The real-world
performance of any software system depends on: (1) the algorithms chosen and (2) the suitability and efficiency of the various layers of implementation. Good algorithm design is therefore crucial for the performance of all software systems. Moreover, the study of algorithms provides insight into the intrinsic nature of the problem as well as possible solution techniques independent of programming language, programming paradigm, computer hardware, or any other implementation aspect.

An important part of computing is the ability to select algorithms appropriate to particular
purposes and to apply them, recognizing the possibility that no suitable algorithm may exist. This facility relies on understanding the range of algorithms that address an important set of welldefined problems, recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, and their suitability in particular contexts. Efficiency is a pervasive theme throughout this area. This knowledge area defines the central concepts and skills required to design, implement, and analyze algorithms for solving problems. Algorithms are essential in all advanced areas of computer science: artificial intelligence, databases, distributed computing, graphics, networking, operating systems, programming languages, security, and so on. Algorithms that have specific utility in each of these are listed in the relevant knowledge areas. Cryptography, for example, appears in the new Knowledge Area on \xref{IAS}, while parallel and distributed algorithms appear the Knowledge Area in \xref{PD}.

As with all knowledge areas, the order of topics and their groupings do not necessarily correlate to a specific order of presentation. Different programs will teach the topics in different courses and should do so in the order they believe is most appropriate for their students.>>}"

Students should acquire an understanding and appreciation of a computer system’s functional components, their characteristics, performance, and interactions, and, in particular, the challenge of harnessing parallelism to sustain performance improvements now and into the future. Students need to understand computer architecture to develop programs that can achieve high performance through a programmer’s awareness of parallelism and latency. In selecting a system to use, students should be able to understand the tradeoff among various components, such as CPU clock speed, cycles per instruction, memory size, and average memory access time.

The learning outcomes specified for these topics correspond primarily to the core and are intended to support programs that elect to require only the minimum 16 hours of computer architecture of their students. For programs that want to teach more than the minimum, the same AR topics can be treated at a more advanced level by implementing a two-course sequence.

"\KADescription{CN}{<<Computational Science is a field of applied computer science, that is, the application of computer science to solve problems across a range of disciplines. In the book Introduction to Computational Science \cref{XXX}, the authors offer the following definition: ``the field of computational science combines computer simulation, scientific visualization, mathematical modeling, computer programming and data structures, networking, database design, symbolic computation, and high performance computing with various disciplines.” Computer science, which largely focuses on the theory, design, and implementation of algorithms for manipulating data and information, can trace its roots to the earliest devices used to assistpeople in computation over four thousand years ago. Various systems were created and used to calculate astronomical positions. Ada Lovelace’s programming achievement was intended to calculate Bernoulli numbers. In the late nineteenth century, mechanical calculators became available, and were immediately put to use by scientists. The needs of scientists and engineers for computation have long driven research and innovation in computing. As computers increase in their problemsolving power, computational science has grown in both breadth and importance. It is a discipline in its own right \cite{xxx} and is considered to be ``one of the five college majors on the rise \cite{xxx} .” An amazing assortment of sub-fields have arisenunder the umbrella of Computational Science, including computational biology, computational chemistry, computational mechanics, computational archeology, computational finance, computational sociology and computational forensics.

Some fundamental concepts of computational science are germane to every computer scientist (e.g., modeling and simulation), and computational science topics are extremely valuable components of an undergraduate program in computer science. This area offers exposure to many valuable ideas and techniques, including precision of numerical representation, error analysis, numerical techniques, parallel architectures and algorithms, modeling and simulation, information visualization, software engineering, and optimization. Topics relevant to computational science include fundamental concepts in program construction (\xref{SDFFundamentalProgrammingConcepts}), algorithm design (\xref{SDFAlgorithmsandDesign}), program testing (\xref{SDFDevelopmentMethods}), data representations (\xref{ARMachinelevelrepresentationofdata}), and basic computer architecture (\xref{ARMemorysystemorganizationandarchitecture}). At the same - 69 - time, students who take courses in this area have an opportunity to apply these techniques in a wide range of application areas, such as molecular and fluid dynamics, celestial mechanics, economics, biology, geology, medicine, and social network analysis. Many of the techniques used in these areas require advanced mathematics such as calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. The descriptions here assume that students have acquired the needed mathematical background elsewhere. In the computational science community, the terms run, modify, and create are often used to describe levels of understanding. This chapter follows the conventions of other chapters in this volume and uses the terms familiarity, usage, and assessment.>>}"

Modeling and simulation of real world systems represent essential knowledge for computer scientists and provide a foundation for computational sciences.

"\KADescription{DS}{<<Discrete structures are foundational material for computer science. By foundational we mean that relatively few computer scientists will be working primarily on discrete structures, but that many other areas of computer science require the ability to work with concepts from discrete structures. Discrete structures include important material from such areas as set theory, logic, graph theory, and probability theory. 

The material in discrete structures is pervasive in the areas of data structures and algorithms but appears elsewhere in computer science as well. For example, an ability to create and understand a proof—either a formal symbolic proof or a less formal but still mathematically rigorous argument—is important in virtually every area of computer science, including (to name just a few) formal specification, verification, databases, and cryptography. Graph theory concepts are used in networks, operating systems, and compilers. Set theory concepts are used in software engineering and in databases. Probability theory is used in intelligent systems, networking, and a number of computing applications. 

Given that discrete structures serves as a foundation for many other areas in computing, it is worth noting that the boundary between discrete structures and other areas, particularly Algorithms and Complexity, Software Development Fundamentals, Programming Languages, and Intelligent Systems, may not always be crisp. Indeed, different institutions may choose to organize the courses in which they cover this material in very different ways. Some institutions may cover these topics in one or two focused courses with titles like ""discrete structures"" or ""discrete mathematics,""whereas others may integrate these topics in courses on programming, algorithms, and/or artificial intelligence. Combinations of these approaches are also prevalent (e.g., covering many of these topics in a single focused introductory course and covering the remaining topics in more advanced topical courses).>>}"

"\KADescription{GV}{<<Computer graphicsis the term commonly used to describe the computer generation and manipulation of images. It is the science of enabling visual communication through computation. Its uses include cartoons, film special effects, video games, medical imaging, engineering, as well as scientific, information, and knowledge visualization. Traditionally, graphics at the undergraduate level has focused on rendering, linear algebra, and phenomenological approaches. More recently, the focus has begun to include physics, numerical integration, scalability, and special-purpose hardware. In order for students to become adept at the use and generation of computer graphics, many implementation-specific issues must be addressed, such as file formats, hardware interfaces, and application program interfaces. These issues change rapidly, and the description that follows attempts to avoid being overly prescriptive about them. The area encompassed by Graphics and Visualization is divided into several interrelated fields:
\begin{subtopics}
\item Fundamentals: Computer graphics depends on an understanding of how humans use vision to perceive information and how information can be rendered on a display device. Every computer scientist should have some understanding of where and how graphics can be appropriately applied as well asthe fundamental processes involved in display rendering.
\item  Modeling: Information to be displayed must be encoded in computer memory in some form, often in the form of a mathematical specification of shape and form. 
\item Rendering: Rendering is the process of displaying the information contained in a model.
\item Animation: Animation is the rendering in a manner that makes images appear to move and the synthesis or acquisition of the time variations of models.
\item Visualization:The field of visualization seeks to determine and present underlying correlated structures and relationships in data sets from a wide variety of application areas. The prime objective of the presentation should be to communicate the information in a dataset so as to enhance understanding 
\item Computational Geometry: Computational Geometry is the study of algorithms that are stated in terms of geometry. 
\end{subtopics}

Graphics and Visualization is related to machine vision and image processing, which are found in the Intelligent Systems (IS) KA, and algorithms such as computational geometry, which are found in the Algorithms and Complexity (AL) KA. Topics in virtual reality arefound in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) KA.

"\KADescription{IAS}{<<In CS2013, the Information Assurance and Security KA is added to the Body of Knowledge in recognition of the world’s reliance on information technology and its critical role in computer science education. Information assurance and security as a domain is the set of controls and processes both technical and policy intended to protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and byproviding for authentication and non-repudiation. The concept of assurance also carries an attestation that current and past processes and data are valid. Both assurance and security concepts are needed to ensure a complete perspective. Information assurance and security education, then, includes all efforts to prepare a workforce with the needed knowledge, skills, and abilities to protect our information systems and attest to the assurance of the past and current state of processes and data. The importance of security concepts and topics has emerged as a core requirement in the Computer Science discipline, much like the importance of performance concepts has been for many years. 

The Information Assurance and Security KA is unique among the set of KAs presented here given the manner in which the topics are pervasive throughout other Knowledge Areas. The topics germane to only IAS are presented in the IAS section; other topics are noted and crossreferenced in the IAS KA. In the IAS KA the many topics are represented with only 9 hours of Core-Tier1and Tier2 coverage. This is balanced with the level of mastery primarily at the familiarity level and the more indepth coverage distributed in the referenced KAs where they are applied. The broad application of the IAS KA concepts (63.5 hours) across all other KAs provides the depth of coverage and mastery for an undergraduate computer science student. 

The IAS KA is shown in two groups: (1) concepts where the depth is unique to Information Assurance and Security and (2) IAS topics that are integrated into other KAs that reflect naturally implied or specified topics with a strong role in security concepts and topics.>>}"

It is used pervasively in support of everyday applications such as email, word-processing and search, as well as in the design and analysis of autonomous agents that perceive their environment and interact rationally with the environment. 

The solutions rely on a broad set of general and specialized knowledge representation schemes, problem solving mechanisms and learning techniques. They deal with sensing (e.g., speech recognition, natural language understanding, computer vision), problem-solving (e.g., search, planning), and acting (e.g., robotics) and the architectures needed to support them (e.g., agents, multi-agents). The study of Artificial Intelligence prepares the student to determine when an AI approach is appropriate for a given problem, identify the appropriate representation and reasoning mechanism, and implement and evaluate it.>>}"

"\KADescription{NC}{<<The Internet and computer networks are now ubiquitous and a growing number of computing activities strongly depend on the correct operation of the underlying network. Networks, both fixed and mobile, are a key part of the computing environment of today and tomorrow. Many computing applications that are used today would not be possible without networks. This dependency on the underlying network is likely to increase in the future. 

The high-level learning objective of this module can be summarized as follows: 
\begin{subtopics}
\item Thinking in a networked world. The world is more and more interconnected and the use of networks will continue to increase. Students must understand how the networks behave and the key principles behind the organization and operation of the networks. 
\item Continued study. The networking domain is rapidly evolving and a first networking course should be a starting point to other more advanced courses on network design, network management, sensor networks, etc.
\item Principles and practice interact. Networking is real and many of the design choices that involve networks also depend on practical constraints. Students should be exposed to these practical constraints by experimenting with networking, using tools, and writing networked software. 
\end{subtopics}

There are different ways of organizing a networking course. Some educators prefer a top-down approach, i.e., the course starts from the applications and then explains reliable delivery, routing and forwarding. Other educators prefer a bottom-up approach where the students start with the lower layers and build their understanding of the network, transport and application layers later. >>}"

In contrast to general purpose programming, platform-based development takes into account platform-specific constraints. For instance web programming, multimedia development, mobile computing, app development, and robotics are examples of relevant platforms that provide specific services/APIs/hardware that constrain development. Such platforms are characterized by the use of specialized APIs, distinct delivery/update mechanisms, and being abstracted away from the machine level. Platform-based development may be applied over a wide breadth of ecosystems. 

While we recognize that some platforms (e.g., web development) are prominent, we are also cognizant of the fact that no particular platform should be specified as a requirement in the CS2013 curricular guidelines. Consequently, this Knowledge Area highlights many of the platforms thathave become popular, without including any such platform in the core curriculum. We note that the general skill of developing with respect to an API or a constrained environment is covered in other Knowledge Areas, such as Software Development Fundamentals (SDF).

\KA{PD}{<<Computación paralela y distribuída.>>}{}	
"\KADescription{PD}{<<The past decade has brought explosive growth in multiprocessor computing, including multi-core processors and distributed data centers. As a result, parallel and distributed computing has moved from a largely elective topic to become more of a core component of undergraduate computing curricula. Both parallel and distributed computing entail the logically simultaneous execution of multiple processes, whose operations have the potential to interleave in complex ways. Parallel and distributed computing builds on foundations in many areas, including an understanding of fundamental systems concepts such as concurrency and parallel execution, consistency in state/memory manipulation, and latency. Communication and coordination among processes is rooted in the message-passing and shared-memory models of computing and such algorithmic concepts as atomicity, consensus, and conditional waiting. Achieving speedup in practice requires an understanding of parallel algorithms, strategies for problem decomposition, system architecture, detailed implementation strategies, and performance analysis and tuning. Distributed systems highlight the problems of security and fault tolerance, emphasize the maintenance of replicated state, and introduce additional issues that bridge to computer networking. 

Because parallelism interacts with so many areas of computing, including at least algorithms, languages, systems, networking, and hardware, many curricula will put different parts of the knowledge area in different courses, rather than in a dedicated course. While we acknowledge that computer science is moving in this direction and may reach that point, in 2013 this process is still in flux and we feel it provides more useful guidance to curriculum designers to aggregate the fundamental parallelism topics in one place. Note, however, that the fundamentals of concurrency and mutual exclusion appear in the Systems Fundamentals (SF) Knowledge Area. Many curricula may choose to introduce parallelism and concurrency in the same course (see below for the distinction intended by these terms). Further, we note that the topics and learning outcomes listed below include only brief mentions of purely elective coverage. At the present time, there is too much diversity in topics that share little in common (including for example, parallel scientific computing, process calculi, and non-blocking data structures) to recommend particular topics be covered in elective courses. 

Because the terminology of parallel and distributed computing varies among communities, we provide here brief descriptions of the intended senses of a few terms. This list is not exhaustive or definitive, but is provided for the sake of clarity. 

\begin{subtopics}
\item Parallelism: Using additional computational resources simultaneously, usually for speedup.
\item Concurrency: Efficiently and correctly managing concurrent access to resources.
\item Activity: A computation that may proceed concurrently with others; for example a program, process, thread, or active parallel hardware component.
\item Atomicity: Rules and properties governing whether an action is observationally indivisible; for example, setting all of the bits in a word, transmitting a single packet, or completing a transaction.
\item Consensus: Agreement among two or more activities about a given predicate; for example, the value of a counter, the owner of a lock, or the termination of a thread.
\item Consistency: Rules and properties governing agreement about the values of variables written, or messages produced, by some activities and used by others (thus possibly exhibiting a data race); for example, sequential consistency, stating that the values of all variables in a shared memory parallel program are equivalent to that of a single program performing some interleaving of the memory accesses of these activities.
\item Multicast: A message sent to possibly many recipients, generally without any constraints about whether some recipients receive the message before others. An event is a multicast message sent to a designated set of listeners or subscribers.
\end{subtopics}

As multi-processor computing continues to grow in the coming years, so too will the role of parallel and distributed computing in undergraduate computing curricula. In addition to the guidelines presented here, we also direct the interested reader to the document entitled ""NSF/TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing - Core Topics for Undergraduates"", available from the website: http://www.cs.gsu.edu/~tcpp/curriculum/. 

General cross-referencing note:Systems Fundamentals also contains an introduction to parallelism (\xref{SF/ComputationalParadigms}, \xref{SF/SystemSupportforParallelism}, \xref{SF/Performance}). 

The introduction to parallelism in SF complements the one here and there is no ordering constraint between them. In SF, the idea is to provide a unified view of the system support for simultaneous execution at multiple levels of abstraction (parallelism is inherent in gates, processors, operating systems, and servers), whereas here the focus is on a preliminary understanding of parallelism as a computing primitive and the complications that arise in parallel 
and concurrent programming. Given these different perspectives, the hours assigned to each are not redundant: the layered systems view and the high-level computing concepts are accounted for separately in termsof the core hours.>>}"

"\KADescription{SDF}{<<Fluency in the process of software development is a prerequisite to the study of most of computer science. In order to use computers to solve problems effectively, students must be competent at reading and writing programs in multiple programming languages. Beyond programming skills, however, they must be able to design and analyze algorithms, select appropriate paradigms, and utilize modern development and testing tools. This knowledge area brings together those fundamental concepts and skills related to the software development 
process. As such, it provides a foundation for other software-oriented knowledge areas, most notably Programming Languages, Algorithms and Complexity, and Software Engineering.

It is important to note that this knowledge area is distinct from the old Programming Fundamentals knowledge area from CC2001. Whereas that knowledge area focused exclusively on the programming skills required in an introductory computer science course, this new knowledge area is intended to fill a much broader purpose. It focuses on the entire software development process, identifying those concepts and skills that should be mastered in the first year of a computer science program. This includes the design and simple analysis of algorithms, fundamental programming concepts and data structures, and basic software development methods and tools. As a result of its broader purpose, the Software Development Fundamentals knowledge area includes fundamental concepts and skills that could naturally be listed in other software-oriented knowledge areas (e.g., programming constructs from Programming Languages, simple algorithm analysis from Algorithms & Complexity, simple development methodologies from Software Engineering). Likewise, each of these knowledge areas will contain more advanced material that builds upon the fundamental concepts and skills listed here. 

While broader in scope than the old Programming Fundamentals, this knowledge area still allows for considerable flexibility in the design of first-year curricula. For example, the Fundamental Programming Concepts unit identifies only those concepts that are common to all programming paradigms. It is expected that an instructor would select one or more programming paradigms 
(e.g., object-oriented programming, functional programming, scripting) to illustrate these programming concepts, and would pull paradigm-specific content from the Programming Languages knowledge area to fill out a course. Likewise, an instructor could choose to emphasize formal analysis(e.g., Big-Oh, computability) or design methodologies (e.g., team projects, software life cycle) early, thus integrating hours from the Programming Languages, Algorithms and Complexity, and/or Software Engineering knowledge areas. Thus, the 43 hours of material in this knowledge area will typically be augmented with core material from one or more of these knowledge areas to form a complete and coherent first-year experience. 

When considering the hours allocated to each knowledge unit, it should be noted that these hours reflect the minimal amount of classroom coverage needed to introduce the material. Many software development topics will reappear and be reinforced by later topics (e.g., applying iteration constructs when processing lists). In addition, the mastery of concepts and skills from this knowledge area requires a significant amount of software development experience outside of class.>>}"

"\KADescription{SE}{<<In every computing application domain, professionalism, quality, schedule, and cost are critical to producing software systems. Because of this, the elements of software engineering are applicable to developing software in all areas of computing. A wide variety of software engineering practices have been developed and utilized since the need for a discipline of software engineering was first recognized. Many trade-offs between these different practices have also been identified. Practicing software engineers have to select and apply appropriate techniques and practices to a given development effort in order to maximize value. To learn how todo so, they study the elements of software engineering.

Software engineering is the discipline concerned with the application of theory, knowledge, and practice to effectively and efficiently build reliable software systems that satisfy the requirements of customers and users. This discipline is applicable to small, medium, and large-scale systems. It encompasses all phases of the lifecycle of a software system, including requirements elicitation, analysis and specification; design; construction; verification and validation; deployment; and operation and maintenance. Whether small or large, following a traditional plan-driven development process, an agile approach, or some other method, software engineering is concerned with the best way to build good software systems.

Software engineering uses engineering methods, processes, techniques, and measurements. It benefits from the use of tools for managing software development; analyzing and modeling software artifacts; assessing and controlling quality; and for ensuring a disciplined, controlled approach to software evolution and reuse. The software engineering toolbox has evolved over the years. For instance, the use of contracts, with requires and ensure clauses and class invariants, is one good practice that has become more common. Software development, which can involve an individual developer or a team or teams of developers, requires choosing the most appropriate tools, methods, and approaches for a given development environment. 

Students and instructors need to understand the impacts of specialization on software engineering approaches. For example, specialized systems include:

\begin{subtopics}
\item Real time systems
\item Client-server systems
\item Distributed systems
\item Parallel systems
\item Web-based systems
\item High integrity systems
\item Games
\item Mobile computing
\item Domain specific software (e.g., scientific computing or business applications)
\end{subtopics}

Issues raised by each of these specialized systems demand specific treatments in each phase of software engineering. Students must become aware of the differences between general software engineering techniques and principles and the techniques and principles needed to address issues specific to specialized systems.

An important effect of specialization is that different choices of material may need to be made when teaching applications of software engineering, such as between different process models, different approaches to modeling systems, or different choices of techniques for carrying out any of the key activities. This is reflected in the assignment of core and elective material, with the core topics and learning outcomes focusing on the principles underlying the various choices, and the details of the various alternatives from which the choices have to be made being assigned to the elective material.

Another division of the practices of software engineering is between those concerned with the fundamental need to develop systems that implement correctly the functionality that is required for themand those concerned with other qualities for systems and the trade-offs needed to balance these qualities. This division too is reflected in the assignment of core and elective material, so that topics and learning outcomes concerned with the basic methods for developing such system are assigned to the coreand those that are concerned with other qualities and tradeoffs between them are assigned to the elective material. 

In general, students can best learn to apply much of the material defined in the Sofware Engineering KA by participating in a project. Such projects should require students to work on a team to develop a software system through as much of its lifecycle as is possible. Much of software engineering is devoted to effective communication among team members and stakeholders. Utilizing project teams, projects can be sufficiently challenging to require students to use effective software engineering techniques and todevelop and practice their communication skills. While organizing and running effective projects within the academic framework can be challenging, the best way to learn to apply software engineering theory and knowledge is in the practical environment of a project. The minimum hours specified for some knowledge units in this document may appear insufficient to accomplish associated applicationlevel learning outcomes. It should be understood that these outcomes are to be achieved through project experience that may even occur later in the curriculum than when the topics within the knowledge unit are introduced. 

Further, there is increasing evidence that students learn to apply software engineering principles more effectively through an iterative approach, where students have the opportunity to work through a development cycle, assess their work, and then apply the knowledge gained through their assessment to another development cycle. Agile and iterative lifecycle models inherently afford such opportunities. 

Software lifecycle terminology in this document is based on that used in earlier sources, such as the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) and the ACM/IEEE-CS Software Engineering 2004 Curriculum Guidelines (SE2004). While some terms were originally defined in the context of plan-driven development processes, they are treated here as generic, and thus equally applicable to agile processes. 

Note: The SDF/Development Methods knowledge unit includes 9 Core-Tier1 hours that constitute an introduction to certain aspects of software engineering. The knowledge units, topics and core hour specifications in this Software Engineering Knowledge Area must be understood as assuming previous exposure to the material described in \xref{SDFDevelopmentMethods}

Many software failures arise from an incomplete understanding of requirements for the software to be developed or inadequate management of those requirements.

Specifications of requirements range in formality from completely informal (e.g., spoken) to rigorously mathematical (e.g., written in a formal specification language such as Z or first-order logic). In practice, successful software engineering efforts use requirements specifications to reduce ambiguity and improve the consistency and completeness of the development team’s understanding of the vision of the intended software. Plan-driven approaches tend to produce formal documents with numbered requirements. Agile approaches tend to favor less formal specifications that include user stories, use cases, and test cases. >>}"

"\KADescription{SP}{<<While technical issues are central to the computing curriculum, they do not constitute a complete educational program in the field. 
Students must also be exposed to the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of the relevant social, ethical, 
legal and professional issues. This need to incorporate the study of these non-technical issues into the ACM 
curriculum was formally recognized in 1991, as can be seen from the following except \cite{xxx}: 

\textit{Undergraduates also need to understand the basic cultural, social, legal, and ethical issues inherent in the discipline of computing. 
They should understand where the discipline has been, where it is, and where it is heading. They should also understand their 
individual roles in this process, as well as appreciate the philosophical questions, technical problems, and aesthetic 
values that play an important part in the development of the discipline.

Students also need to develop the ability to ask serious questions about the social impact of computing and to evaluate 
proposed answers to those questions. Future practitioners must be able to anticipate the impact of introducing a given 
product into a given environment. Will that product enhance or degrade the quality of life? What will the impact be upon 
individuals, groups, and institutions? 

Finally, students need to be aware of the basic legal rights of software and hardware vendors and users, and they also need 
to appreciate the ethical values that are the basis for those rights. Future practitioners must understand the responsibility 
that they will bear, and the possible consequences of failure. They must understand their own limitations as well as the 
limitations of their tools. All practitioners must make a longterm commitment to remaining current in their chosen specialties 
and in the discipline of computing as a whole} 

As technological advances continue to significantly impact the way we live and work, the critical importance of social
issues and professional practicecontinues to increase; new computer-based 
products and venues pose ever more challenging problems each year. It is our students who must enter the workforce 
and academia with intentional regard for the identification and resolution of these problems. 

Computer science educators may opt to deliver this core and elective material in stand-alone courses, integrated into traditional 
technical and theoretical courses, or as special units in capstone and professional practice courses. The material in this 
familiarity area is best covered through a combination of one required course along with short modules in other courses. On the 
one hand, some units listed as Core Tier-1 (in particular, Social Context, Analytical Tools, Professional Ethics, and Intellectual Property) 
do not readily lend themselves to being covered in other traditional courses. Without a standalone course, it is difficult to cover these 
topics appropriately. On the other hand, if ethical and social considerations are coveredonly in the standalone course and not “in context,” 
it will reinforce the false notion that technical processes are void of these other relevant issues. Because of this broad relevance, it is important 
that several traditionalcourses include modules with case studies that analyze the ethical, legal, social and professional considerations in the 
context of the technical subject matter of the course. Courses in areas such as software engineering, databases,computer networks, 
information assurance andsecurity, and introduction to computing provide obvious context for analysis of ethical issues. However, an 
ethics-related module could be developed for almost any course in the curriculum. It would be explicitly against the spirit of the recommendationsto have only a standalone course. Running through all of the issues in this area is the need to speak to the 
computing practitioner’s responsibility to proactively address theseissues by both moral and technical actions. The ethical issues discussed in any class should be directly related to and arise naturally from the subject matter of that class. Examples include a discussion in the database course of data aggregation or data mining, or a discussion in the software engineering course of the potential conflicts between obligations to the customer and obligations to the user and others affected by their work. Programming assignments built around applications such ascontrolling the movement of a laser during eye surgery can help to address the professional, ethical and social impacts of computing. Computing faculty who are unfamiliar with the content and/or pedagogy of applied ethics are urged to take advantage of the considerable resources from ACM,IEEE-CS, SIGCAS(special interest group on computers and society), and other organizations.

It should be noted that the applicationof ethical analysis underlies every subsection of this Social and Professional knowledge area in computing. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) provides guidelines that serve as the basis for the conduct of our professional work. The General Moral Imperatives provide an understanding of our commitment to personal responsibility, professional conduct, and our leadership roles.>>}"
