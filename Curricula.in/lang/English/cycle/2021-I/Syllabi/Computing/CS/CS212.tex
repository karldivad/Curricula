\begin{justification}
An algorithm is, essentially, a well-defined set of rules or instructions that allow solving a computational problem.
The theoretical study of the performance of the algorithms and the resources used by them, usually time and space, allows us to evaluate if an algorithm is suitable for solving a specific problem, comparing it with other algorithms for the same problem or even delimiting the boundary between Viable and impossible.
This matter is so important that even Donald E. Knuth defined Computer Science as the study of algorithms.
This course will present the most common techniques used in the analysis and design of efficient algorithms,
with the purpose of learning the fundamental principles of the design, implementation and analysis of algorithms for the solution of computational problems
