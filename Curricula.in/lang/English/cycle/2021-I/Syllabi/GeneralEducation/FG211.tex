\begin{justification}
Ethics is a constitutive part inherent to the human being, 
and as such it must be reflected in the daily and professional 
actions of the human person. 

It is indispensable that the person assumes an active role in 
society because the economic-industrial, political and social 
systems are not always in function of values and principles, 
being these in reality the pillars on which all the action of 
professionals should be based.
\end{justification}
