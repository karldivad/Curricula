\begin{justification}

The course develops in students the skills to deal with models of science and engineering skills. In the first part
of the course a study of the functions of several variables, partial derivatives, multiple integrals and an
introduction to vector fields is performed. Then the student will use the basic concepts of calculus to model
and solve ordinary differential equations using techniques such as Laplace transforms and Fourier series.
