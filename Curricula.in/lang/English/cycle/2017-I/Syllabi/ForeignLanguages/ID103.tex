\begin{justification}
A fundamental part of the integral formation of a professional is the ability to communicate in a foreign language in addition to the native language itself.
It not only broadens its cultural horizon but also allows a more humane and comprehensive view of life. In the case of foreign languages, undoubtedly English is the most practical because it is spoken around the world. There is no country where it is not spoken. In careers related to tourist services, English is perhaps the most important practical tool that the student must master from the outset as part of his / her integral education
