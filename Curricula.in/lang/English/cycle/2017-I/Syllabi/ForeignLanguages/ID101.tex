\begin{justification}
A fundamental part of the integral formation of a professional is the ability to communicate in a foreign language in addition to the native language itself. 
It not only broadens its cultural horizon but also allows a more humane and comprehensive view of people's lives. In the case of foreign languages, English is undoubtedly the most pratical because it is spoken around the world. There is no country where it is not spoken. In careers related to tourist services English is perhaps the most important practical tool that the student must master from the outset as part of his comprehensive education.
