\begin{justification}
During the plenary sessions, there will be lectures related to the methodology of Design Thinking as well as its use and importance in the creation processes. Also, during these sessions we will have presentations on entrepreneurships and startups related to engineering or technology.
During lab sessions, students form teams that maintain during the cycle. With the guidance of the teacher and through the methodology of Design Thinking developed in the plenary sessions, students will have to present innovative solutions to real problems inspired by the United Nations "Global Challenges".
The students will have a Digital Log which will be constantly reviewed by the teachers in charge. In it will be the advances, processes and referents of the group project. The course culminates with the presentations of the proposals put forward by the groups.
