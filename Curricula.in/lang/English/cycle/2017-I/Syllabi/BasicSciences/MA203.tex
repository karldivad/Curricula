\course{MA203. Estadística y Probabilidades}{Obligatorio}{MA203}

\begin{justification}
It provides an introduction to probability theory and statistical inference with applications, needs in data analysis, design of random models and decision making.
% Buses arrive late, chemical reactions have varying reactions rates and demand is unknown beforehand. To understand this uncertain world, we need statistics and probability theory.
% This course is designed for students to gain the capacity of statistical and probability reasoning.
% Using active projects this course covers the fundamentals of descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as, the fundamentals of probability theory.
\end{justification}
