\course{MA102. CÃ¡lculo en varias Variables}{Obligatorio}{MA102} % Common.pm

\begin{justification}
This course introduces the first concepts of linear algebra as well as numerical methods with an emphasis on problem solving with the Scilab open source libe package.
Mathematical theory is limited to fundamentals, while effective application for problem solving is privileged.
In each subject, a few methods of relevance for engineering are taught. Knowledge of these methods prepares students for the search for more advanced alternatives, if required.
