\begin{justification}
The world has changed due to the use of fabric and related technologies, rapid, timely and personalized access to the
information, through web technology, ubiquitous and pervasive; they have changed the way we do things, how do we think? and how does the industry develop?
Web technologies, ubiquitous and pervasive are based on the development of web services, web applications and mobile applications,
which are necessary to understand the architecture, design, and implementation of web services, web applications and mobile applications.
\end{justification}
