\begin{justification}
The Quechua communicative course allows students to approach the practical use of the Andean language in their Chanca variety. This is one of the varieties of greater diffusion and model to approach other varieties of denominated Quechua southern or Quechua II. In addition, it is simple in its learning to share sounds with Castilian. Also, the course seeks to familiarize the student with the basic structures of this language, as well as with the translation and production of texts. The ultimate goal is to provide the basic learning tools so that the student can express himself at a basic and functional level, as well as lead and develop his own language learning.
We believe that speaking Quechua in certain situations where UTEC engineers have to develop is a very important advantage: native Quechua speakers practice a differentiated treatment with people who speak it because they feel that their tradition is being respected and, at the same time, Making an effort to engage in dialogue in their own language. This represents very specific operational advantages in the treatment and the agreement of interests.
