\course{AM0037. Ciencia de Materiales}{Obligatorio}{AM0037} % Common.pm

\begin{justification}
The introduction and innovation of this course begins with the selected presentation of the general fundamentals on Materials Science and Engineering.
Then, it focuses on seminars on the family of materials: metals and alloys, ceramics and glass, polymers and copolymers, and composites and nanomaterials.Applications encompass traditional and state-of-the-art materials. 
The study of these applications covers the role played by the materials, the same applications and their relevance. Advanced cases on materials and innovative applications of potential relevance on the Peruvian context are covered.
